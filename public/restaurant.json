Soup has the bread crumbs in almost melted state, mocktails were average and our only Savior was pasta and caramel pudding... This place has high potential but let down by dull ambience, pretty slow and inattentive staff. Buffet price was listed as 399 but was charged 499, We still went ahead and took the deal to be very disappointed!! Most dishes were freshly cooked hence going with some starts else would rate them lower. I did not find a single person who seemed happy with their meal as moat complained about one thing or the other. That'll be my last visit San Churros.\")]",

In this meal, u will get paneer gravy, Plain dal, White rice, 3 phulkas, curd, pickle, onions and 1 pakoda. To begin with, I will say the phulkas were soft and nice. It goes well with both the gravies. Dal was watery though!! Rice also goes well with both the gravy's, but it tastes better with Paneer gravy. Paneer pieces were not soft. It was a little hard. Curd tasted nice! Instead of pakoda, they cud have given some small dessert like jamun or kheer etc. Nevertheless, it was average fare for the night. Don't have complaints though.

The pricing is okay. Not too cheap and not too expensive.\\nComing to the Food, we tried the Nachos with guacamole and this was really good. I definitely loved this one. It had coloured Nachos with guacamole and tasted delicious. The cajun spiced potato wedges were too oily but tasted decent. The Chilli cheese toast, had too much of mayo than cheese, but was decent nevertheless. The taiwanese babycorn was way too sweet,with a bit of chilli here and there.
